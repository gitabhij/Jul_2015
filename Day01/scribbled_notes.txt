Objects are stored in the heap
References are in the stack
Comparing references using == compares the location/address

Strings are immutable
Do not use string classes when you have to manipulate a lot
Leads to creation of lot of objects
Use StringBuffer or StringBuilder classes in case of manipulations
Use Strings when you have to almost treat them like constants.


Strings can be created using new or without using new keyword
Stick to one way of creating strings
Strings are reference types
If you use without new an Internal object is created.
String literals are stored in the String pool.
For Strings use .equals() to compare the values


All variables and methods begin with lowercase
All classes begin with uppercase
CamelCasing is followed in naming
Give meaningful names for all entities
